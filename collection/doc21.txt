About eConcordia eConcordia is the gateway for all fully online credited courses at Concordia University. Our mission is to provide each Concordia faculty member with reliable, cost-effective online course development and delivery resources, and consequently empower students with knowledge through accessible, engaging and quality online learning experience. Our team includes instructional designers, graphic and multimedia designers, video producers, programmers, web developers, quality assurance specialists and, of course, Concordia faculty members. Once a course has been developed, we provide instructors with the technical and administrative support needed to continually improve the course and, subsequently, the online learner experience. Moreover, we design and conduct surveys, evaluations, interviews, focus groups, and other types of data collection methods with learners to find ways to improve on their experience with the courses. Based on these and together with each faculty member we plan alterations to the course content and/or online course design.
